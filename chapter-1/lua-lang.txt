==================================
What is Lua?
==================================

Lua consists of two parts - the Lua interpreter and the functioning software
 system. The Lua interpreter is written in ANSI C, making it highly portable
  on low memory and low storage systems.

Lua scripts are text files that end in the '.lua' file extension. They can
 then be run with the command:
  lua foo.lua

While Lua is interpreted, it precompiles code into an intermediary form
 before running it. This code can be viewed by running a command:
  lauc foo.lua

This will creat a new file, 'luac.out', which will contain the compiled
 instructions.

For example, a lua file to print "Hello World!" would contain:


foo.lua
------------------
print("\nHello World!\n")
------------------


Then, when running 'luac foo.lua', the output will be:


luac.out
------------------
uaT�

xV(w@�@exercise-01.lua���Q
                          ��DF��print�
Hello World!
�������_ENV
------------------





==================================
Lua Data Types
==================================

Lua has eight data types:
- boolean
- number
- nil
- string
- function
- userdata
- table
- thread

Lua is dynamically typed, so not type qualification needs to exist to during
 variable name declarations.

The 'nil' type represent the absence of data, similar to null in
 other languages.

Tables are the only data structure of Lua. Tables are objects that represent
 arrays, packages, or other data structures like sets. An array indici can
  be a number, or any other value, such as a string, but it cannot be nil.
   Tables are also not fix-sized and do not store only one kind of data.


To start a Lua repl, after Lua is installed, run the command:

/bin/bash
------------------
lua
------------------

Code can then be run to test small snippets in a Lua REPL environment.

------------------
my_array = {}   -- empty table
my_array['first'] = 1      -- table array index 'first' set to number 1
my_array['second'] = 2     -- table array index 'second' set to number 2
my_array['second'] = false -- table array index 'second' set to boolean false

type(44.3)      -- data type of '44.3' is a number
type(false)     -- date type of 'false' is a boolean
type("Lua")     -- data type of "Lua" is a string
type(my_array)  -- data type of 'my_array' is a table
------------------



==================================
Loops & Functions
==================================

-- Preface for variable delcarations:
    Every variable in Lua is global, unless declared with 'local'.
    Declaration with 'local' will force the varaible to become local to a chunk

A simple if statement follows 'if-then-else' syntax.


foo.lua
------------------
if wait_time > 10 then patients = 0 end

if wait_time == 10 then
-- do something

else

-- do another thing

end
------------------
