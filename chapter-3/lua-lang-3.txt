Lua - Variables
==================================

In general, variables are a name given to a stroage area that programs
 can manipulate. It can hold different types of values including
  functions and tables.


In Lua, there are three types of variables:

1.) Global Variables
  - All variables are global unless declared as local

2.) Local Variables
  - A varaible that has a scope limited within the function
     it is declared in

3.) Table Fields
  - A special type of variable that can hold anything except
     for nil including functions


Variable definition means to tell the interpreter where and how much create
 the storage fo a variable.

The base syntax of a variable declaration is

------------------
type variable_list
------------------

Where the word 'type' is optionally local, or type specified makig it global.

The world 'variable_list' means that a declaration may consist of one or
 more identifier names spearated by commas.


foo.lua
------------------
local i, j
local i
local a,c
------------------


All three lines above declare and defines varialbes, with the line
 'local i,j' meaning that both variables 'i' and 'j' are defined, but are
   limited to a local scope.

Variables can also be initialized, which means to assign a value, in their
 declaration.

The base syntax of a variable declaration and initialization is:


------------------
type variable_list = value_list;
------------------


Some examples are:


foo.lua
------------------
local d, f = 5, 10
d, f = 5, 10;
d, f = 10
------------------


In the first line above, variables 'd' and 'f' are local variables
In the second line above, variable d and f are global variables.
In the third line above, 'd' and 'f' are global, and 'f' is nil.

In the above code, this follows an order of assignment:


------------------
v1, v2 = n1, n2
------------------

variable v1 is assigned the value of n1,
 variable v2 is assigned the value of n2


This can lead to some neat things for variable assignment:


foo.lua
------------------
-- Variable definition
local a, b

-- Variable Initialization
a = 10
b = 30
print("value of a:", a)
print("value of b:", b)

-- Swapping of variables

b, a = a, b
print("value of a:", a)
print("value of b:", b)

f = 70.0/3.0
print("value of f:", f)
------------------




Lua considers varaible expressions as having one of two values:

1.) lvalue
- A memroy location named that is called "lvalue", this value can either 
   be on the left-hand or right-hand of an assignment.

2.) rvalue
- A memory location that is stored in some address in memory. An rvalue
   expression cannot have a value assigned to it, so it is only allowed
    to appear on the right-hand side, but not theleft hand side.

- An example of an 'lvalue' would be a variable name.

- An example of an 'rvalue' would be a number. A number can only appear on
 the right side.


A valid statement would be:

foo.lua
------------------
g = 20
------------------


A non-valid statement would be:

foo.lua
------------------
10 = 20
------------------


It is also possible to have multiple lvalues and rvalues in the same line.

foo.lua
------------------
g, l = 20, 30
------------------
