==================================
Lua - Functions
==================================

A function is a group of statements that perform a task. Re-usable code can
 be written as a function to perform a specific task.

Lua provides numerous built-in methods that a program can call, such as
 "print()", to print the argument passed as input.


The syntax of a function is:

------------------
optional_function_scope function function_name (arguments)
  -- function_body
  return result_params_comma_separated
end
------------------


These individual parts are:
- Optional Function Scope: Use of the keyword local to limit the scope of a
   function, or to make it a global funciton.

- Function Name: The identifier of the function.

- Arguments: A placeholder for a value passed into the function from outside
   of its scope.

- Function Body: The collectio nof statements that define what the method does.

- Return: Data that is passed back to the program, outside of the functional
   scope, to the scope that called the function.



foo.lua
------------------
function max(num1, num2)
  if(num1 > num2) then
    result = num1;
  else
    result = num2;
  end
return result;
end
------------------


If a function uses arguments, the function must declare the varaibles that
 accept the values of the arguments. This are called "formal parameters".
