# lua-language-book
Reading through the Lua Programming Language book.

This repo will only be showing the lua files that I used to learn how the language works. If you are interested in picking up the book, and helping the Lua project, check it out [here](https://www.lua.org/docs.html#books).

The version I picked up is on the Rakuten Kobo book store [here](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/lua-programming-language-2024).
